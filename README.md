## Detecting Vacant Parking Spots
Using Intersection over union to check wether a parking spot is vacant or occupied.
-Labeling and recording the coordinates of the whole parking space (Defined parking space in a parking lot) and storing the result.
-Passing the image / video to our trained model which detects the coordinates of the cars
-Using IOU formula with coordinates of detected cars and parking space. Calculating how much of the car covers the parking space
-Following threshold to give the final result.
